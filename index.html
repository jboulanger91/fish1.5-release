    # Fish1.5 Release

    ## A Connectomic Resource for the Larval Zebrafish Brain

    The [Lichtman laboratory](http://lichtmanlab.fas.harvard.edu) and [Engert laboratory](http://www.engertlab.org) at Harvard University, in collaboration with the [Connectomics team at Google](https://research.google), are releasing the Fish1 dataset and its companion paper. Fish1 is the comprehensive whole‑brain connectomics dataset for the 7‑day post‑fertilization (7 dpf) larval zebrafish, combining electron microscopy (EM) and confocal light microscopy (LM) from the same specimen.

    The resulting EM dataset, acquired at a resolution of **4 nm × 4 nm × 30 nm**, provides ultrastructural details such as synaptic connections and subcellular features. This volume includes **187,053 cell bodies** encompassing the zebrafish brain, spinal cord and ganglia, with **26,915 vglut2a‑positive** and **14,510 gad1b‑positive** cells.

    The dataset is editable through a collaborative proofreading tool, **CAVE**, allowing the community to reconstruct neurons of interest, analyze their connectivity, and overlay neurotransmitter information to test their circuit models.
